**Institution:** Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Music Technology Group

**Funding body:** This project is funded by Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Phonos foundation
Objectives and duration of the project: The goal of this study is to study how using AI,
or smart computer systems, could make searching for sounds in big online libraries better
and easier. Right now, if you want to find a sound in these big collections, it might be tricky
because you have to know exactly what to look for. We think these smart systems can help
people by letting them use natural language, or the way we talk every day, to find what they
need more easily. The duration of this project is 6 weeks.

**Methodology and participation:** If you wish to participate in this online survey, we first
ask you for your level of English proficiency, and if you have any experience with online sound libraries.
You will then be presented with a sound, a description of a sound, or an image.
We ask you to write down how you would search for a fitting sound using an imagined system.
You can choose to skip a task if you like.
You need to write your answers in English.
After you finish three sets of these examples, we ask you if you would like to end the survey or continue. You can do 7 sets in total.
The time required to complete the survey with three sets of questions is approximately 12 minutes.

**Inclusion criteria for participation:** This experiment is openly accessible on the internet, 
and its content is suitable for all individuals. However, due to legal reasons, participation is
restricted to individuals above the age of 14. Additionally, we encourage participation from
English speakers with experience in using large-scale sound libraries.

**Privacy:** To protect your privacy, we will not identify your data with your name, but
rather with a code that will only be known to the research team members. In order to make
data only accessible to research team members, digital data will be stored with access control
systems. In the event of data publication, only anonymous data will be published.
Anonymized data may be hosted or published in a public repository. The data collected
during the experiment cannot be used to identify you. Thus, once the experiment concludes,
we will not be able to delete the data you generated, should you ask for it. It is important to
refrain from including any personal data or identifiable information within your responses,
particularly in the free-form text fields designated for open-ended questions. This measure is
crucial to maintain your anonymity and safeguard your privacy.

**Risks and benefits:** Participating in this study does not entail risks greater than those
ordinarily encountered in daily life. Additionally, we cannot and do not guarantee that you
will receive any benefits from this study.

**Voluntary nature of participation:** Your participation in this study is on a voluntary
basis and you may withdraw from the study at any time without having to justify why.

**Contact information:** If you have any question about this study, you may contact the IP
(Dr. Frederic Font, <frederic.font@upf.edu>) or Benno Weck
(<benno.weck01@estudiant.upf.edu>).

If you have doubts, complaints, or questions about this study or about your rights as a
research participant, you may contact UPFâ€™s Institutional Committee for the Ethical Review
of Projects (CIREP) by phone (+34 93 542 21 86) or by email (<secretaria.cirep@upf.edu>).
CIREP is not part of the research team and will treat any information you send confidentially.
